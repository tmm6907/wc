# Web Component Library
### A Vanilla JS web component library with some reactivity.

This project is for fun and to improve HTML, CSS, JS skills while implementing some traditional JS framework features/methodologies using vanilla JS syntax.

## Things I'm looking into:
- Reef.js for it's implementation of signals.
